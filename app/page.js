        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio? Well I just wanted to put everything together
          somewhere, so why not here?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here you can see all of my *hopefully* finished projects, links to my
          blogs that are on other sites, & some of my artsy/design related
          stuff!
        </p>
        <p>See ya!</p>
